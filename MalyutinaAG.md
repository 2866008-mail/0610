Idk that text but I'm so glad that we have that instruction 

Thank you!

# Instruction for Markdown

## Text highlighting
If you want do cursive text, highlight word by symbol * or _ on both sides

Example: * kitty * or _ kitty _ will be *kitty*

If you need bold font? Highlight word by ** or _ _ (without sracing) how we explain, supra

Example: ** kitty ** or __ kitty __ will be **kitty**

You may ask - why there are two ways to highlight the same selection?

But without this, how would you highlight a word both in cursive and bold?

Example: * __ kitty __ * will be *__kitty__*

## Lisis
If you need list something, you can use:
 * dots
 1. numbers

 Dots displayed with * or +

Example: * kitty or + kitty (at new string) will be
* kitty

Numbers displayed number with dot

Example: 3. kitty (at new string) will be

3. kitty

## Working with images
If you want add image, text this:

! [this text will be print, if an error occurs] (file name. it must to be in in the monitored folder)

Example: ! [kitty!] (file.name) 

will be display like

![kitty!](1043.jpg)
